# 🩺 SkinAI — AI-powered Skin Lesion Risk Assessment

SkinAI is an **AI-based image analysis project** designed to **assist users in assessing the potential risk of skin lesions** (benign vs malignant) from photos.

⚠️ **SkinAI is NOT a medical diagnostic tool.**  
It is an **informational and decision-support application** intended to encourage medical consultation when a potential risk is detected.

---

## 📌 Project Motivation

Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, where **early detection is critical**.

SkinAI aims to:
- raise awareness,
- encourage early medical consultation,
- demonstrate how computer vision and deep learning can assist in **risk assessment**, not diagnosis.

This project is developed as a **personal AI/ML project** and should be viewed as an educational and preventive tool.

## 🚨 Important Disclaimer (Ethics & Legal)

> **SkinAI does NOT provide medical diagnoses.**  
> The results generated by the model are **indicative only** and may be inaccurate.  
> **SkinAI does not replace a dermatologist or any medical professional.**

If you notice a suspicious skin lesion or have health concerns, **consult a qualified healthcare professional immediately**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Binary image classification: **Benign vs Malignant**
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled dermoscopic images
- Focus on **generalization and overfitting control**:
  - Data augmentation
  - Batch normalization
  - Dropout
  - Early stopping
  - Learning rate scheduling

### Key Metrics (Validation/Test Set)

- **Accuracy:** ~87.6%
- **F1-score (malignant):** ~0.88
- **Recall / Sensitivity (malignant):** ~88.4%
- **ROC-AUC:** ~0.95
- **PR-AUC:** ~0.95

These results indicate **strong discriminative capability on the evaluation dataset**, while acknowledging real-world limitations.

## 📊 Confusion Matrix (Threshold = 0.50)

|                | Predicted Benign | Predicted Malignant |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **True Benign** | 434              | 66                  |
| **True Malignant** | 58           | 442                 |

> Thresholds can be adjusted to favor **higher sensitivity** (fewer false negatives) depending on use-case.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🧠 Machine Learning
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**

### 📱 Application (Planned)
The mobile/web application layer is **not yet implemented**, but the planned stack is:

- **Frontend**
  - React (or React Native for mobile)
  - Tailwind CSS
- **Backend / API**
  - FastAPI (Python)
  - REST API for inference
- **Model Serving**
  - TensorFlow SavedModel
  - ONNX / TensorFlow Lite (future optimization)
- **Deployment (future)**
  - Docker
  - Cloud GPU / CPU inference

---

## 📱 Application Vision

The future SkinAI application will:
- allow users to upload or capture an image,
- return a **risk score or category** (Low / Medium / High),
- strongly encourage **medical consultation when risk is elevated**.

No medical verdicts will ever be displayed.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Model performance depends on image quality (lighting, focus, angle).
- Dataset bias may affect real-world generalization.
- The model does not account for patient history, evolution over time, or clinical context.
- Not validated for clinical or diagnostic use.

---

## 🔒 Ethics & Responsibility

SkinAI is developed with the following principles:
- Transparency about limitations
- No false reassurance
- No diagnostic claims
- Clear medical disclaimers
- User safety first
